When submit is pressed in index.js, all the selected options from the drop downs will be sent as a single object with properties named after the name of the list where they were selected. i.e. the select with name='genre'
will appear as a property with the name 'genre'.

Look in index.js to see an example of how we can access this data when 'submit' is clicked
